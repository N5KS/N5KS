Welcome to all

I am a retired network engineer with 50 years experience in the telecommunications industry.  My hobbies are amateur radio (54 years), electronics (56 years) and home machine shop (7 years).

I have a never ending need to learn, especially when my hobbies are involved.  I bought my first computer in 1979 and learned BASIC.  Soon after I took an after hours college course to learn FORTRAN.  Since that time, I have learned C, C++, C#, perl, java, javascript, ruby and recently python.  Although I have learned to use each of these, I am an amateur programmer at best.  By far, I am more comfortable with C than anything else.
